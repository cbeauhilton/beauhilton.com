*Crede mihi, bene qui latuit bene vixit* (Ovid, *Tristia* III.IV.25).

I am a rather boring and dull person.

With time and luck, I hope to become more so.

Favorite movies are [Megane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1016307/), 
[Babette's Feast](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092603/), 
and [Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096928/).

Favorite books are [*Deep River* by Shūsaku Endō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_River_(novel)),
[*One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich* by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_in_the_Life_of_Ivan_Denisovich),
and [*I Want My Hat Back* by Jon Klassen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_My_Hat_Back).

The best song is ["I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" by The Proclaimers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Gonna_Be_(500_Miles)).
This is not negotiable nor controvertible.

I'm not sure what my favorite song is,
but [Blaze Foley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaze_Foley),
[John Prine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Prine),
or [Count Bass D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Bass_D) 
probably wrote it.
