     I enjoy treating people with any cancer, but have a particular
affinity for head-and-neck and upper GI cancers (together, 2/3 of the
‚Äúaerodigestive‚Äù cancers, the other 1/3 being lung). There are many right
ways to be a doctor, but the way I understand my role is this: to be
with people in their suffering and their joy (suffering is everywhere,
but there is a special joy known only in the oncology clinic), to see
and know the soul within the body (whatever the tumor or the scalpel or
the radiation beam or the drug has done to that body), to cure when I
can (and deal with the fallout from that cure), and help always (to the
end and beyond).
    </p>
    <p>
     There are glimmers of hope and serious advances in recent years, but
these remain horrible diseases, many of which have few treatment options
once they‚Äôve reached an advanced stage, and the treatments we do have
tend to be quite difficult to tolerate. Most cancers can be disfiguring,
but these especially so, whether from the tumors themselves or from the
therapies. Aerodigestive cancers also disproportionately affect folks
who live out in the country, or in the cities but with few resources,
and these folks are my folks.

     We need to help each other, and there is much to do.

The Vanderbilt Internal Medicine Handbook was started by Mike Neuss,
MD/PhD in the late 2010s when he was a resident. It‚Äôs an incredible
resource, primarily envisioned as a physical book to keep in your white
coat pocket for quick, authoritative reference. It had a website when I
came to Vandy, but the UX‚Ä¶ left something to be desired. I rebuilt it
into its current state (website and infrastructure only - each section
has its own author(s)), and help maintain the back end.

     It‚Äôs used globally, and one of my goals is to make it easier for
smaller, particularly international programs to have their own versions.
It uses only free and open-source software, and fits comfortably into
pretty much any free server despite being a fairly large book with
multimedia.
    </p>
    <p>
     The main problem is that updating the content, while it is just in
Markdown (a very simple text format you can learn in ~7 minutes), feels
a little too tech-y to be comfortable for people who haven‚Äôt spent time
in a code text editor. What it really needs is funding, and a part-time
developer with protected time.

     overview
    </h3>
    <p>
     My work has morphed over the years, as everyone‚Äôs does, but the
consistent thread and drive throughout has been on coaxing large, messy,
complex data to tell us a story about ourselves, about all of us as
societies and neighborhoods as well as each one of us individually, to
empower us to speak our own sequels.
    </p>
    <p>
     To translate that into buzzwords, for your bingo game: I‚Äôm an
oncologist who uses explainable artificial intelligence among other
techniques to diagnose and address healthcare disparities, including
democratizing personalized medicine and pursuing synergies in the global
academic-industrial complex.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was trained as an anthropologist, where reductionism is an insult,
at the same time that I was trained as a scientist, where reductionism
is the central conceit. Despite the way I set up that last sentence,
there is no true conflict, as the goal for most scientists and
anthropologists is the same: to make things at least a little better for
someone, but hopefully a lot better for everyone. Modern anthropology is
inherently activist, far from the crusty sepia-toned image of a staid
researcher sitting just outside the village campfire furiously
scribbling in a notebook, and so is modern medical research (we all read
Tuskegee and are appalled and want to do better, though precious few
become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Farmer">Paul
Farmer</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
     Data science was an unexpected boon, a set of tools that lets me deal
with staggering complexity in a disciplined way, to a degree unifying
the anthropologist‚Äôs drive to let the data be itself (messy, human) with
the scientist‚Äôs drive to simplify.
    </p>
    <p>
     I became acquainted with using code to model the world when I was
doing physics research (equivalent circuit modeling and scanning laser
doppler vibrometry on a Nigerian-style clay pot drum, total hoot, I <a href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.3654998">presented</a> it at the
Acoustical Society of America Annual Meeting and we published it in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.4789892">JASA</a>), and the
research-centric medical school at Cleveland Clinic gave me the better
part of five years and a supportive environment to dive in deeper to
computer science, machine learning, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now that have the freedom to choose my own direction, data science
projects that were informed by anthropology but had centroids in other
disciplines have become squarely within the overlap of my personal Venn
diagram.
    </p>
    <p>
     Additionally, as I have moved from academia to the worlds of private
practice and industry, I am increasingly inspired toward using these
interests to hit cancer where it needs it the most: in the clinic of the
community oncologist, where the vast majority of cancer patients receive
care, by bringing timely insights from every relevant axis to bear on
every visit.
    </p>
    <p>
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free">Information
almost wants to be free</a>, and there is now so much of it, that a lot
can be done for free or at a low cost. (I‚Äôm take special glee in
byproducts, ‚Äúdigital waste,‚Äù some say, but there is gold in them there
hills - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Ban">Shigeru
Ban</a> is my hero). There are abstracts from conferences aplenty
describing the cutting edge of everything, usually seen as jots and
tiddles on the march of science forward but forgotten when the journal
article gets published, and lab values and imaging results and clinic
notes generated in the usual course of patient care, used once or a few
times and then forgotten and discarded in the wake of what comes next -
in all of this digital refuse I believe there are insights to be gained,
efficiencies to be achieved, lives to be saved.

     disparities in cancer research across space and time
    </h3>
    <p>
     This ongoing project starts with a custom metadata archive of all the
abstracts from the two big annual cancer meetings (ASH and ASCO - as a
starting point), made machine-readable and hence more easily accessible
en masse. Here‚Äôs a <a href="https://ash-abstracts.vercel.app/abstracts_small/abstracts">rough
prelim</a> of what that looks like, with an interactive map and
sorting/search/export (you can hit JSON or CSV endpoints trivially to
get nicely formatted data, as opposed to the hulking web scrapers and
HTML wranglers I wrote to get the data the first time). Analyses are
planned on the authors and affiliations (global mapping, with a time
component), and how those overlap with disease states (e.g. how much
sickle cell research comes out of Sub-Saharan Africa? We know it‚Äôs bad,
but nobody has quantified how bad - the idea is to have a platform for
answering these questions easily), before branching out into things like
conflicts of interest and various analyses using NLP, etc.

    <h3>
     explainable machine learning for readmissions, with a focus on
sociodemographics
    </h3>
    <p>
     While at Cleveland Clinic, I was one of the founding members of the
Center for Clinical Artificial Intelligence, and its first dedicated
analyst. We had the delightful opportunity to work with a rich dataset
from one of the world‚Äôs largest hospitals, focused on predicting the
risk of readmission (discharging from the hospital and ‚Äúbouncing back‚Äù
too soon) and extended length of stay. We had access to not only health
data, but socioeconomic data, for millions of patients, and I further
enriched this with census data.
    </p>
    <p>
     With only an address and a date, one can learn about a person‚Äôs
neighborhood in incredible detail (though not the person themselves -
the US Census is wise about privacy in the data they publish). It turns
out that a person‚Äôs neighborhood is a major predictor in their health
outcomes, as is their insurance provider, in addition to a host of
health parameters and hospital process clues.
    </p>
    <p>
     I used interpretable machine learning techniques, with a focus on
revealing actionable items that the patients and medical teams could
hope to influence, as well as to call out structural issues that
organizations and governments need to know. One of the problems with
machine learning is that it can only ever restate (and in some cases, as
it feeds back on itself, more firmly entrench) the biases that led to
the historical data you fed to it. If you design it to show you these
biases, show you <em>all</em> of its biases, explicitly, to tell you
exactly how much a person‚Äôs race, ethnicity, gender, and neighborhood
played a role in its predictions (alongside medical diagnoses and lab
values), you have transformed an algorithm from a potentially
destructive tool, a heinous thing that pushes hurting people farther
down, into a tool for positive change. If these biases are shown in an
easy-to-read visual, that patients, clinicians, and administrators can
all understand, all the better. See what it looks like <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-020-0249-z">here</a>.

    <h3>
     explainable machine learning for blood cancer diagnostics
    </h3>
    <p>
     Initially, when I was going to be a malignant hematologist (I still
think it is a beautiful field, but was drawn away to other pastures), I
wanted to level the playing field for advanced diagnostics.
    </p>
    <p>
     A world-class hematopathologist together with a world-class
clinician, preferably a whole group of these together, are required to
make certain diagnoses, and these only after at least one invasive
biopsy. What if we could mobilize the rich genetic and phenotypic data
available in simple blood samples and from the electronic medical record
to support diagnostics, and, eventually, democratize them? Further, what
if the answer the machine gives could be not only accurate, but
interpretable?
    </p>
    <p>
     What if we could get the machine to explain itself and its reasoning,
both as a check against biological implausibility (and more insidious
problems such as systemic racism), and to reveal more areas for
research? What if a high resolution bone marrow biopsy image could be
read in moments by a smart phone in rural
Arkansas/Kandahar/Mogadishu/Kushalnagar/etc., instead of having to be
shipped to one of a handful of academic centers while the patient waits,
still sick, for an answer?
    </p>
    <p>
     We made <a href="https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-126967">some</a>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004755">progress</a>,
but these problems remain largely unsolved.
