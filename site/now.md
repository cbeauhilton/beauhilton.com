Ted Hawkins' song "[Sorry You're Sick](https://youtu.be/jTO-zb6XTzg)" 
reminds me of the book 
[*One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_in_the_Life_of_Ivan_Denisovich)
by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,
and the uncomfortable and sublime truth that all medicine is palliative medicine.
