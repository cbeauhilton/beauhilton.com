    There are a lot of embedding models out there for LLMs.
  ColbertV2 is a neat one.

    <title>The first detailed description of living with esophageal cancer -
John Casaubon’s 1690 diary</title>
    <updated>2024-04-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">
    John Casaubon was an English surgeon in the late 1600s
who developed an esophageal tumor in late 1690 
and wrote about it in his diary
before dying in January of 1691.
It's harrowing, enlightening, and strangely beautiful.
This blog post is the only place in the world you can read the full transcription of the diary entry.

    <title>Writing clinical notes using AI - a practical experience</title>
    <updated>2024-04-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">
    With Claude 3 Opus (a newish ChatGPT4 competitor) as my copilot, I wrote a pretty darn good SOAP note
    for an (invented yet realistic) new consult visit. It took a little massaging to get it right,
    but boy howdy, it did a great job. Here are the prompts and outputs. 
    This stuff has serious potential for streamlining the boring and tedious parts of the job.

    <title>Drugs we can’t get: S1</title>
    <updated>2024-03-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">
    There are a number of interesting drugs used in the global market that,
    for one reason or another, do not have FDA approval and are therefore inaccessible
    in the US, at least outside of clinical trials. S1 is one of them: a better capecitabine.

    <title>Patient-facing slide decks</title>

    <content type="html">
    While I plan on being a physician-scientist forever, I'm not going to work in academia.
Over the past few years I've put together very cool infrastructure for giving academic talks (click "talks" above),
and it was making me sad that it might not get much use after I leave the university.
But then, a ray of sunshine: Why not use my slide deck infrastructure to help in patient conversations?

    A couple of friends and I wrote a review article on the history of esophageal cancer.

    <updated>2021-09-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">
    Most big institutions have guest and employee wifi networks.
Guest wifi is usually fine, fast enough for the basics,
but far inferior to employee wifi.
On a custom-built OS, such as a fairly minimalist Linux distribution, 
getting the employee wifi to work
can be a beast.
