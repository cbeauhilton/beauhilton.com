    <h2>
     Before the beginning
    </h2>
    <p>
     A long, long time ago, potentially in a galaxy far, far away, but
maybe right here, who knows, two sons were discussing their plans for
the kingdom with their father.
    </p>
    <p>
     One said,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son and I will redeem all
mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it;
wherefore give me thine honor.
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     The other was much less verbose:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     (Moses 4: 1-2)
    </p>
    <h2>
     The meridian of time
    </h2>
    <p>
     Fast forward an indefinite amount of time. Things happened. The
second one came to earth to live. This was a big deal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of the night he came, much has been written. My favorite of these, a
poem written just a few hundred years after the fact, goes a little
something like this:
    </p>
    <h3>
     On the Night of the Nativity
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Pure is the present night, in which the Pure One appeared, Who came
to purify us.<br>
Let our hearing be pure, and the sight of our eyes chaste, and the
feeling of the heart holy, and the speech of the mouth sincere.<br>
The present night is the night of reconciliation; therefore, let no one
be wroth against his brother and offend him.<br>
This night gave peace to the whole world, and so, let no one
threaten.<br>
This is the night of the Most Meek One; let no one be cruel.<br>
This is the night of the Humble One; let no one be proud.<br>
Now is the day of joy; let us not take revenge for offenses.<br>
Now is the day of good will; let us not be harsh.<br>
On this day of tranquility, let us not become agitated by anger.<br>
Today God came unto sinners; let not the righteous exalt himself over
sinners.<br>
Today the Most Rich One became poor for our sake; let the rich man
invite the poor to his table.<br>
Today we received a gift which we did not ask for; let us bestow alms to
those who cry out to us and beg.<br>
The present day has opened the door of heaven to our prayers; let us
also open our door to those who ask of us forgiveness.<br>
Today the Godhead placed upon Himself the seal of humanity, and humanity
has been adorned with the seal of the Godhead.
     </p>

     St. Ephraim the Syrian, CE 306-373
    </p>
    <h2>
     Luke 18: 10-43
    </h2>
    <p>
     The baby grew into a boy, then a man.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sometime in his early 30s, he went around causing trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here are a few examples of the kinds of infuriating stories he told,
all taken from a continuous chunk of a book written a few years
back.
    </p>
    <p>
     10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Sunday School
President in a medium-sized ward in Hendersonville (Pharisee), and the
other a tax collector (publican).
    </p>
    <p>
     11 The Sunday School President (Pharisee) stood and prayed thus with
himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are,
extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector
(publican).
    </p>
    <p>
     12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.
    </p>
    <p>
     13 And the tax collector (publican), standing afar off, would not
lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast,
saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.
    </p>
    <p>
     14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than
the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he
that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
    </p>
    <p>
     15 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them:
but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
    </p>
    <p>
     16 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children
to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of
God.
    </p>
    <p>
     17 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of
God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.
    </p>
    <p>
     18 And a certain Relief Society President (ruler) asked him, saying,
Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
    </p>
    <p>
     19 And Jesus said unto her (him), Why callest thou me good? none is
good, save one, that is, God.
    </p>
    <p>
     20 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy
mother.
    </p>
    <p>
     21 And she (he) said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
    </p>
    <p>
     22 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto her (him), Yet
lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the
poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
    </p>
    <p>
     23 And when she (he) heard this, she (he) was very sorrowful: for she
(he) was very rich.
    </p>
    <p>
     24 And when Jesus saw that she (he) was very sorrowful, he said, How
hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
    </p>
    <p>
     25 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle‚Äôs eye, than
for a rich woman (man) to enter into the kingdom of God.
    </p>
    <p>
     26 And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?
    </p>
    <p>
     27 And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible
with God.
    </p>
    <p>
     35 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Nashville
(Jericho), a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
    </p>
    <p>
     36 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.
    </p>
    <p>
     37 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
    </p>
    <p>
     38 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on
me.
    </p>
    <p>
     39 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his
peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on
me.
    </p>
    <p>
     40 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and
when he was come near, he asked him,
    </p>
    <p>
     41 Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said,
Lord, that I may receive my sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     42 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved
thee.
    </p>
    <p>
     43 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,
glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto
God.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is the same story over and over again, from slightly different
angles. Make the main character overtly righteous, or rich, or
pretentious (‚ÄúJesus - much too good for children‚Äù), or, on the other
hand, make the main character of a hated profession, or poor, or (in
other stories) a woman with a checkered past. A son with a grand plan
and proud of it, a son who just wants to be helpful. All the same, from
the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shortly after telling these outrageous stories, and many others
besides, he was killed. That‚Äôs quite the story too.

    <h2>
     Abbot Moses in the desert
    </h2>
    <p>
     A few hundred years later, not far from where he was buried and rose
again, a bunch of grumpy dudes moved to the desert.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of them was named Moses and, much to his chagrin, the group of
grumps decided to make him one of the bishops (abbot).
    </p>
    <p>
     Abbot Moses was asked to sit on a council to judge one of the monks
who had committed a fault.
    </p>
    <p>
     ‚ÄúAnd taking with him a very old basket full of holes, he filled it
with sand, and carried it with him. He said ‚ÄòMy sins are running out
behind me, and I do not see them, and today I come to judge the sins of
another!‚Äô‚Äù

    <h2>
     1800-something
    </h2>
    <p>
     Fast forward nearly one or two thousand years (who‚Äôs keeping track
anyway), and a fellow named Heber tells the following story:
    </p>
    <h2>
     Heber J Grant and the devil
    </h2>
    <p>
     Some years ago a prominent man was excommunicated from the Church.
He, years later, pleaded for baptism. President John Taylor referred the
question of his baptism to the apostles, stating in a letter that if
they unanimously consented to his baptism, he could be baptized, but
that if there was one dissenting vote, he should not be admitted into
the Church. As I remember the vote, it was five for baptism and seven
against. A year or so later the question came up again and it was eight
for baptism and four against. Later it came up again and it was ten for
baptism and two against. Finally all of the Council of the Apostles,
with the exception of your humble servant, consented that this man be
baptized and I was then next to the junior member of the quorum.
    </p>
    <p>
     Later I was in the office of the president and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
     ‚ÄúHeber, I understand that eleven of the apostles have consented to
the baptism of Brother So and So,‚Äù naming the man, ‚Äúand that you alone
are standing out. How will you feel when you get on the other side and
you find that this man has pleaded for baptism and you find that you
have perhaps kept him out from entering in with those who have repented
of their sins and received some reward?‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
     I said, ‚ÄúPresident John Taylor, I can look the Lord squarely in the
eye, if he asks me that question, and tell him that I did that which I
thought was for the best good of the kingdom. ‚Ä¶ I can tell the Lord that
that man had disgraced this Church enough, and that I did not propose to
let any such a man come back into the Church.‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
     ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said President Taylor, ‚Äúmy boy, that is all right, stay with
your convictions, stay right with them.‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
     ‚Ä¶
    </p>
    <p>
     I left the president‚Äôs office. I went home. ‚Ä¶ I was reading the
Doctrine and Covenants through for the third or fourth time
systematically, and I had my bookmark in it, but as I picked it up,
instead of opening where the bookmark was, it opened to:
    </p>
    <p>
     ‚ÄúI, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is
required to forgive all men; but he that forgiveth not his brother
standeth condemned before the Lord.‚Äù [See D&amp;C 64:9‚Äì10.]
    </p>
    <p>
     And I closed the book and said: ‚ÄúIf the devil applies for baptism,
and claims that he has repented, I will baptize him.‚Äù After lunch I
returned to the office of President Taylor and I said, ‚ÄúPresident
Taylor, I have had a change of heart. One hour ago I said, never while I
live, did I expect to ever consent that Brother So and So should be
baptized, but I have come to tell you he can be baptized, so far as I am
concerned.‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
     President Taylor had a habit, when he was particularly pleased, of
sitting up and laughing and shaking his whole body, and he laughed and
said, ‚ÄúMy boy, the change is very sudden, very sudden. I want to ask you
a question. How did you feel when you left here an hour ago? Did you
feel like you wanted to hit that man right squarely between the eyes and
knock him down?‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
     I said, ‚ÄúThat is just the way I felt.‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
     He said, ‚ÄúHow do you feel now?‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
     ‚ÄúWell, to tell you the truth, President Taylor, I hope the Lord will
forgive the sinner.‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
     He said, ‚ÄúYou feel happy, don‚Äôt you, in comparison. You had the
spirit of anger, you had the spirit of bitterness in your heart toward
that man, because of his sin and because of the disgrace he had brought
upon the Church. And now you have the spirit of forgiveness and you
really feel happy, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
     And I said, ‚ÄúYes I do; I felt mean and hateful and now I feel
happy.‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
     And he said: ‚ÄúDo you know why I wrote that letter?‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
     I said: ‚ÄúNo, sir.‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
     ‚ÄúWell I wrote it, just so you and some of the younger members of the
apostles would learn the lesson that forgiveness is in advance of
justice, where there is repentance, and that to have in your heart the
spirit of forgiveness and to eliminate from your hearts the spirit of
hatred and bitterness, brings peace and joy; that the gospel of Jesus
Christ brings joy, peace and happiness to every soul that lives it and
follows its teachings.‚Äù
    </p>
    <h2>
     Wrap up
    </h2>
    <p>
     I was asked to give a talk on what it means to have a broken heart
and a contrite spirit, in what ways we are asked to sacrifice, and what
I have consecrated to the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
     I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôve consecrated nor sacrificed much. Camel am
I.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, I figured I‚Äôd try to work out what the broken heart and contrite
spirit stuff is about.
    </p>
    <p>
     The best I way I know how to do that is to try and define the
opposite - what‚Äôs the opposite of a broken heart?
    </p>
    <p>
     It can‚Äôt be a merely intact heart, that‚Äôs not enough of an
opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
     What about a hard heart?
    </p>
    <p>
     ‚ÄúThe opposite of a broken heart is a hard heart.‚Äù That seems like a
reasonable assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ok, then contrite spirit? What‚Äôs the opposite of that?
    </p>
    <p>
     What the heck does contrite mean?
    </p>
    <p>
     Con - that usually means ‚Äúwith.‚Äù With ‚Äútrite‚Äù? Huh?
    </p>
    <p>
     Turns out that trite, in this word, comes from Proto-Indo-European
‚Äú*tere-‚Äù, which means to crush, thresh, grind, that kind of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, to be ‚Äúcontrite‚Äù is to be ground down, worn out, crushed - and
the opposite of that? Built up, high and mighty, not just intact but
overly stacked.
    </p>
    <p>
     A hard heart, and pride, are the opposite of a broken heart and
contrite spirit. That‚Äôs not hard to figure out, but I‚Äôm kinda dumb so it
took me a while to get there.
    </p>
    <p>
     When I thought about the specific examples from the scriptures and
other great writings, about these characteristics and their opposites,
they are stories about superiority, missives about mollification.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the beginning, God chose not the son with the grand plan and
eloquent speech, but the humble servant, willing to be molded into
whatever was needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jesus‚Äôs anger wasn‚Äôt at the sinner, but at the proud - the Pharisee
who thought himself better than the publican, the ruler who identified
with his possessions, the disciples who thought children and blind
beggars unworthy of Jesus‚Äô attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     Abbot Moses kept his heart clean by letting the sins run out the
bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Heber Grant‚Äôs heart was hard with judgment, yet the Lord softened his
heart with forgiveness, demolishing Heber‚Äôs own pride and an imagined
pride he was placing on the Church itself, and when his heart finally
broke he immediately felt freedom and love.
    </p>
    <p>
     Brothers and sisters, I don‚Äôt think that a broken heart and contrite
spirit means we should be sad all the time, though going through sadness
and remorse is certainly part of what softens the heard and grinds down
the spirit and gets it ready. I think it means that we are malleable in
the Lord‚Äôs hands, seeing ourselves as the least of these, and therefore
above no task the Lord sets for us - whether that is letting go of our
own plans, our own things, or our own sense of righteousness. The task
he gives us might be forgiving someone, including ourselves - how often
is the impossibility of self-forgiveness a symptom of thinking we know
better than God, who can turn scarlet to wool and water to wine, or that
we are special in our ability to be worse than everyone around us?
    </p>
    <p>
     These are not trivial - we might be tasked to forgive a monster
(which is different than remaining subject to their monstrosity), to go
somewhere we never wanted to go - including to the bishop‚Äôs office, to
the law, to rehab, to Nashville or Provo or Arkansas.
    </p>
    <p>
     The secret is this: in all of these things, the deck is stacked in
our favor, the dealer is infinitely patient, and the player who stays in
the game (or comes back to it, even for the last hand) always wins.
