I'm a husband, father, physician, and data scientist.

This site has five main parts:

- A [now page](/now.html) shows what I'm up to at the moment.
- Writing, posts linked individually farther down the page (when I finish migrating old posts from [here](https://cbeauhilton.github.io) and writing new ones.)
- [Notes](https://memex.beauhilton.com) on things, in memex form.
- [Software repositories](https://git.beauhilton.com).
- Hidden files at unlisted links for my convenience, and yours if we're [chums](https://www.etymonline.com/word/chum).

If you would like to get in touch,
email me:

Here's the [RSS feed](/rss.xml) for this page.
