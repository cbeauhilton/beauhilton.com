## home

6 humans, 1 dog, an ever-changing number of chickens.

Just took out the summer garden, winter plants are in.

Hendersonville, TN.

## work

Second year of oncology fellowship (out of four).

I have a half-day of my own clinic, the remainder is research
(other than the odd week or weekend on call).

It feels strange and wonderful to get paid more to do less.

Trainee salaries are public - here's the [VUMC trainee salary page](https://www.vumc.org/gme/stipends).
I'm a PGY4 now, 
and this year, per plan, 
we started receiving extra Harrison Society salary support on top of the PGY4 pay.
This adds up to about 30% more pay overall compared to last year,
for a fraction of the in-hospital working hours 
(I can destroy myself to my heart's content with research hours - 
I'm trying to find a balance).
Overall, this combination is good for the family, and for my sanity. 
God bless the Harrison Society (this is, in every way, a sincere statement).

## *et cetera*

I've got my home server working about how I like it.

One of the things I'm using daily is a pipeline 
for downloading audiobooks and podcasts, 
arranging them just so (automatically), 
and making them available to any of my devices,
synchronized.

It is so, so great. It's nice and easy to share too - 
every family member has an account and can use it from anywhere in the world.

It goes something like: [readarr](https://readarr.com/) -> 
[audiobookshelf server](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) -> 
[tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) mesh network ->
audiobookshelf [apps](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf-app#audiobookshelf-mobile-app).

I took a break from the more heavy medical and philosophy stuff I was listening to
to revisit [The Wheel of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time).
I read these, most of them more than once, when I was a kid,
but the publication of the last two books coincided with becoming much more busy 
(and, probably, regrettably, starting to prefer a smart phone to a paperback),
so I never finished the story.
It's time, and the audiobooks are a boon, 
hundreds of hours of wonderfully read prose.
After this I'll probably go back to [The Fellow on Call](https://www.thefellowoncall.com/) and
[Two Onc Docs](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/two-onc-docs/id1616541733)
as a board refresher. And I won't have to switch apps!
