## Consulting

If you are contacting me to request data science consulting, 
write to the email above with "consulting" somewhere in the subject.

I am currently willing to discuss engagements, pending specifics.

My rate is $300/h for strictly consulting 
(talking - phone calls, meetings, etc.),
unless you are a student, in which case it's free.
I may discount if you want to discuss data science
having to do with healthcare disparities,
particularly if you are willing to publish.

If you want me to write code,
I'm not interested in any engagements worth less than $3,000.
Write a basic specification and make an offer.
