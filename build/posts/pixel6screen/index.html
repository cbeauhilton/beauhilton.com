    <h1>
     Pixel 6 DIY screen replacement, with fingerprint reader calibration
using Linux
    </h1>
    <p>
     <time id="post-date">2023-09-19</time>
    </p>
    <p id="post-excerpt">
     The internet, up to now, says you need Windows or MacOS to calibrate the Pixel's fingerprint reader after installing a new screen and digitizer.
The internet, up to now, was wrong.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Physical install
    </h2>
    <p>
     My wife‚Äôs Pixel 6‚Äôs screen stopped working. Phone seemed to be ok
otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
     We looked at the cost of replacing the phone vs repairing the
screen.
    </p>
    <p>
     A similarly capable phone would cost quite a bit more than the
replacement screen kit, which was ~$130 from <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/google-pixel-6-screen-genuine">iFixit</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     So we bought the replacement screen, watched a few videos on YouTube,
and were off to the races.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tear-down and physical installation were easy. Kudos to Google
for making the Pixels easy to work on. I won‚Äôt give much detail here:
just use the videos, whichever ones have a bunch of views.
    </p>
    <p>
     I did waste the included screen adhesive on the first go-around,
because I didn‚Äôt realize that the broken screen I removed had been
separated from its frame (so the old frame was still installed and I
installed the adhesive to the its top, rather than in the phone casing
where it belongs, and found out when the phone wouldn‚Äôt click back
together with the new screen). It was about $10, including shipping, for
a second adhesive (also iFixit). Fit like a glove.
    </p>
    <p>
     Total $140, and Verizon sent us a free new Pixel 7 anyway (long
story), so now my wife has the 7 and I upgraded from my old Pixel 2XL to
this refurb‚Äôd 6. Dang, what an upgrade. Even though the Pixel 6 is
widely considered the dud of the group, I‚Äôm loving it.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Fingerprint reader calibration is needed
    </h2>
    <p>
     After it was all installed and working well, the next hurdle was
recalibrating the fingerprint reader. The fingerprint reader is part of
the new screen, and needs calibrated, or it will not even attempt to
work (seems more an ‚Äúactivation‚Äù than a ‚Äúcalibration,‚Äù no?).
    </p>
    <p>
     The website Google provides for calibration is <a href="https://pixelrepair.withgoogle.com/udfps">https://pixelrepair.withgoogle.com/udfps</a>.
If you look around the internet for troubleshooting related to this
tool, you‚Äôll see a number of old posts recounting various problems, most
of which seem to have been ironed out by this writing.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, the one problem I couldn‚Äôt find a fix or happy update for
was how to use that website if you‚Äôre not running Windows or MacOS.
    </p>
    <p>
     <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/xq82ri/pixel_6_fingerprint_calibration/">This
Redditor couldn‚Äôt get it working on Linux or Windows, bad luck?</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/217589152?pli=1">Anon
is very angry at Google for not supporting Linux for the calibration
(ctrl-F ‚Äúlinux‚Äù to find)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     We no longer have anything but Linux/OpenBSD systems in the house
(while I love FOSS and feel glee in this, it is not entirely on purpose,
and I don‚Äôt hate Windows or MacOS - my wife‚Äôs MBP met an early demise at
the thrown milk cup of a boisterous toddler, or I would have tried that
machine first to avoid the possible headache of ironing out a solution
for Linux for a [hopefully] one-time computing event.).
    </p>
    <p>
     The udfps website was finding my phone, but refusing to go further. I
was in fastboot. Browser didn‚Äôt matter (tried OG google-chrome-stable,
vivaldi-stable, firefox). USB-A vs USB-C computer-side connection didn‚Äôt
matter (some folks mentioned needing USB-A, so I tried). Activating
Android developer mode didn‚Äôt help, and activating USB debugging within
the developer options didn‚Äôt either.
    </p>
    <p>
     I saw some posts talking about installing USB drivers to get udfps to
work for Windows machines, so decided to poke around and see if maybe it
was a driver issue on Linux as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     It (probably) was.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Android build tools to the rescue
    </h2>
    <p>
     On Arch Linux (these tools are widely available, distro doesn‚Äôt
matter, this is just what I used):
    </p>
    <pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-sh"><span class="hl slc"># enable multilib - see link below</span>
paru <span class="hl slc"># make sure things are up to date generally</span>
paru <span class="hl kwb">-S</span> android<span class="hl kwb">-tools</span> android<span class="hl kwb">-sdk-build-tools</span> <span class="hl slc"># includes adb and other goodies</span>
reboot
</code></pre>
    <p>
     Re multilib - not sure if this is strictly needed - see <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/android#Android_Emulator">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/android#Android_Emulator</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     After grabbing the Android build tools listed above and rebooting,
the website found my phone and ran the calibration software without a
hitch. The website didn‚Äôt seem to work prior to rebooting, and I‚Äôm a
lazy cretin/wizened ol‚Äô wannabe sysadmin, so fancy a reboot to fix all
of life‚Äôs woes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The phone does need at least one reboot to activate the calibration
and enable the fingerprint reader, but the calibration software tells
you that, no secret magic here.
    </p>
    <p>
     I don‚Äôt recall if I used vivaldi-stable or google-chrome-stable to
run udfps, but I think it was the prior (I bet any Chromium-based
browser would work, provided the right system tools are in place).
    </p>
    <p>
     I also can‚Äôt remember if I used USB-A to USB-C or dual-sided USB-C,
but I think it was the dual USB-C.
    </p>
    <p>
     I do think developer mode and USB debugging active on the phone are
required, but I‚Äôm not completely certain.
    </p>
    <p>
     I did this all on a Thinkpad T14s.
    </p>
    <p>
     In any case, fingerprint unlock is a go!
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost too easy.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Manual clean up - what, you think this is NixOS?
    </h2>
    <p>
     You probably won‚Äôt need these tools again, at least not for a long
while, so:
