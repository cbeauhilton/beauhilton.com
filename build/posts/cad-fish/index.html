     Cold agglutinin disease: fish out of water?

     Cold agglutinin disease is a fascinating and strange phenomenon, and might happen because we're fish.
    </p>
    <h2>
     CAD: a matter of degree
    </h2>
    <p>
     CAD is a disease of the cells that make the immune system, in which
they overproduce a protein called cold agglutinin, resulting in a
cascade of unfortunate events that are typically triggered by the blood
getting slightly too cold (going outside in the winter, getting ice
cream out of the freezer, drinking a Slurpie, etc.). Red blood cells
clump together and cause painful, blue fingers/toes/etc., sometimes so
severe the affected bits die and fall off, and an autoimmune attack on
the red blood cells begins, resulting in some of them being eaten alive
by the liver and spleen and others being (literally) exploded while
still in the blood vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everybody has cold agglutinins, these proteins that cause the
clumping (‚Äúagglutination‚Äù), at some low level. They‚Äôre a type of IgM, a
class of large proteins that are a key part of the immune system. IgM is
really good at sticking things together, which is exactly what you want
to happen in certain infections, etc., but which happens aberrantly, and
sometimes dramatically, with red blood cells in CAD.
    </p>
    <p>
     All red blood will agglutinate at 0-5C. This has been known since, at
the latest, 1903. Karl Landsteiner figured it out. He‚Äôs the guy who won
the Nobel Prize for discovering blood types, which was based on
experiments with ‚Äúiso-agglutination.‚Äù With blood typing came the ability
to cross-match blood for safe transfusion, which resulted in a huge leap
forward in our ability to help people who lose a lot of it, as in
surgery and trauma. We think of Landsteiner as the blood typing dude,
but it‚Äôs probably more accurate and expansive to think of him as the
dude who first exhaustively characterized the different situations in
which blood agglutinates.
    </p>
    <p>
     Landsteiner‚Äôs discoveries came just in time for the World Wars, and
folks got to collecting blood in earnest, on a massive scale. We went
from a few laboratory fridges with dozens or hundreds of blood samples
for experiments, to blood banks worldwide, collectively full of hundreds
of thousands of units of blood for use in the operating room and
battlefield. Some oddities about human existence are only found when the
numbers grow to this size: blood bank technicians found that some blood
agglutinates all the way up to 25C (~77F, ‚Äúroom temperature‚Äù). This
resulted in difficulty with accurately typing blood, which led to a
number of deaths.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1946 Lubinski and Goldbloom at Johns Hopkins published a paper
describing seven patients with blood that would agglutinate all the way
up to 37C (98.6F). All of these patients had brisk hemolysis (red blood
cell explosion).
    </p>
    <p>
     Putting it together, we have three categories of blood agglutination
in response to temperature: everyone‚Äôs blood will agglutinate in a
freezer, a small but significant portion of people have blood that
agglutinates at room temperature, and there are an unfortunate few who
have blood that agglutinates while still (relatively) warm in their
bodies. In all of these cases, it‚Äôs a cold agglutinin, a certain IgM
protein, that coordinates the clumping.
    </p>
    <p>
     As a doctor I can accept that sometimes the body does horrible
things, about which the most that can be fairly said, despite all that
science can provide, is that they are random. A person‚Äôs blood deciding
to turn on them at the slightest cold provocation is well within the
realm of crazy things we deal with on a daily basis. I would love to
understand why everything horrible happens, but often have to move
forward only knowing that it does happen, and hope that there might be a
thing or two I can do to offset the horribleness.
    </p>
    <p>
     I can also accept that unnatural environments lead to unnatural
phenomena, such as blood clumping in a freezer. That‚Äôs a
physical/chemical situation that never happens in a living animal (at
least, in vertebrates. Don‚Äôt get me started on the Antarctic midge).
There doesn‚Äôt need to be an evolutionary justification for the clumping
in this case, just a biochemical one.
    </p>
    <p>
     It‚Äôs the room temperature thing that bothers me. In physiologic
findings that are so clearly a matter of degree, with an obvious sliding
scale, I wonder: what in our deep past created the affordance for this
thing in the first place? Why do we have cold agglutinins at all?
    </p>
    <h2>
     Whence cold agglutinins? Probably fish. And fish are us.
    </h2>
    <p>
     Sigbjorn Berentsen is a Norwegian physician and researcher (CAD is,
as you might expect, much more common in colder climates), and is The
Man when it comes to understanding and treating CAD in the modern
era.
    </p>
    <p>
     A recent paper from him had this to say about the most likely
possibility of the origin of cold agglutinins:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      ‚Ä¶the physiological function of CAs has not been clarified. It is
difficult to envision a functional role of antibodies with a temperature
optimum way below body temperature. Comparative studies, however, have
strongly indicated that the evolution of the adaptive immune system
began with the jawed vertebrates. Cartilaginous fish, which are
phylogenetically ancient and considered closely related to the first
jawed vertebrates, have only one immunoglobulin class in common with
humans: IgM‚Ä¶ [T]he temperature optimum of CAs is much closer to the
environmental and body temperature of non-mammal sea vertebrates.
Furthermore, CAs can react with antigens other than RBC surface
macromolecules, and structures closely related to the I antigen are
present on some microorganisms such as Streptococcus and Listeria
species. Thus, one might explain human CAs as remnants of a primitive
vertebrate immune system.
     </p>
    </blockquote>

    </p>
    <p>
     So, ancient fish, swimming in room temperature or colder water, had
to fight certain bacteria. The fish are us, if you go back far enough.
We happened to have held on to this ability, these proteins, an
immunologic vestigial tail. Certain proteins on our red blood cells look
an awful lot like the proteins on those bacteria, and, if you are
unlucky enough that your vestigial tail grows out more than the average
bear, friendly fire ensues. (That last sentence has a staggering number
of mixed metaphors. Smiling, tongue firmly in cheek, he turned to you
and said, ‚ÄúHumans <em>are</em> mixed metaphors.‚Äù)

    <h2>
     Conclusion, prefaced by an aside on Jaron Lanier
    </h2>
    <p>
     Jaron Lanier is a computer scientist, ethnomusicologist, and
all-around wonderful weirdo who was behind a lot of the early virtual
reality experiments in the 70s-80s (and now works on VR with Microsoft
when he‚Äôs not putting on concerts showcasing Chinese mouth-organs). He
would do this thing where he would create VR avatars with many more
limbs than humans (lobster is a classic one) and attach sensors to the
participants to allow them to control all the limbs with various subtle
movements (hips, elbows, knees, etc.). They found that it didn‚Äôt take
long for the humans to achieve surprising proficiency acting as a
&gt;4-limbed creature, and he would wax poetic about the ancient
phylogenetic compatibility still hidden in the motor centers of the
brain, and other related, delicious ideas (maybe it‚Äôs not four limbs and
20 digits that are mapped discretely and <em>a priori</em> into the
human brain, maybe it‚Äôs the capacity to map any number of prehensile
bits that is inherent, etc. The therapeutic and geeky possibilities
leading from this are way too much fun to contain in an aside).
    </p>
    <p>
     Anyway, the point it this: I love it when the answer is, ‚Äúidk, maybe
we‚Äôre fish. What‚Äôs a fish, anyway?‚Äù
