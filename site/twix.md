## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups butter softened
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 cups all purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 11 ounces caramels (_we made our own, but only because the store didn't have any caramels that weren't individually wrapped_)
- 1 tablespoon evaporated milk or cream
- 2 cups milk chocolate chips
- 2 teaspoons shortening


## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat.
- Place the butter in the bowl of a mixer and beat until light and fluffy. Add the powdered sugar and beat until combined.
- Add the vanilla extract, flour and salt to the bowl. Mix until combined.
- Place the dough on a sheet of plastic wrap. Fold the plastic wrap around the dough and chill in the freezer for 20 minutes.
- Flour your work surface and roll out the dough into a 1/2 inch sheet. 
- Use a 2 or 3 inch round cookie cutter to cut out cookies (_we used 8 oz Mason jars_). 
- Place the cookies 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheet.
- Bake the cookies for 12-13 minutes or until edges are light brown. Repeat the process with the remaining dough.
- Cool the cookies on a rack.
- Place the caramels and evaporated milk in a bowl. Microwave at 45 second increments until caramel is melted. Stir until smooth.
- Place a spoonful of caramel onto each cookie, using the back of the spoon to spread it to the edges of the cookie.
- Let the cookies sit until caramel has firmed up, about 20 minutes.
- Place the milk chocolate chips and shortening into a bowl. Microwave in 30 second increments until chocolate is melted. Stir until smooth.
- Place a spoonful of melted chocolate onto each cookie and spread it over the caramel layer.
- Let the cookies sit until the chocolate has hardened, then serve or store in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

## Notes

- These are super sticky. Wrap in wax paper.
- Taste better, with better mouthfeel, if moderately chilled.
