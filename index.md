# Hi!

How's it going?

I am migrating from my old, fancy blog style
to a simpler one that will be
easier to maintain,
as well as more useful.

The old site is available
[here](https://cbeauhilton.github.io).

If you'd like,
check out my old blog posts in raw form,
and a few other things
at [git.beauhilton.com](https://git.beauhilton.com).

If you would like to get in touch,
email me:
cbeauhilton@gmail.com.
