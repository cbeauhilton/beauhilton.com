# Wishlist

While there are always 
[ten thousand material things](https://rosewhitemusic.com/piano/writings/ten-thousand-things/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Ten%20Thousand%20Things%E2%80%9D%20is,The%20One%20produced%20the%20two.)
I want,
some of which are in the Amazon Wishlist below,
I'm more into digital capability these days.

Digital, use-anywhere gift cards are the way to go.

E.g. Visa or MasterCard.

## beauhilton.com

I use [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/) to host my server, 
which in turn hosts this website.
It's also $5 a month, 
which is a great deal for a server that I fully manage 
and is plenty powerful for a simple website.

Happy to receive any funds to support this going forward.

## \*.beauhilton.com

There are a bunch of services I would love to add to my website.

E.g. 
[AudioBookShelf](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf) could be audiobooks.beauhilton.com, 
[Kavita](https://wiki.kavitareader.com/en) could be books.beauhilton.com, 
[Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#nextcloud-all-in-one) could be cloud.beauhilton.com, 
etc.

Would ideally use a little independent server space for each of these, e.g. a Linode.


## Amazon
