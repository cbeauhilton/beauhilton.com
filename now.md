# Starting Residency
I finished [medical school](https://portals.clevelandclinic.org/cclcm/),
matched into internal medicine residency
and hematology-oncology (blood cancer) fellowship
at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the [Harrison Society](https://medicine.vumc.org/harrison-society).

I started July 1st.

So far I've done an inpatient cancer rotation
(solid tumors, rather than leukemias or other blood cancers),
and an emergency department rotation.

I really like taking care of people
who are at the borders of life and death,
whether that's due to their cancer,
or psychiatric disease
that's making them homicidal or suicidal.

# TN
Vanderbilt is in Tennessee.
We bought a house in Hendersonville.
Hendersonville is a lovely place.
We live a few minutes from the water,
and started learning how to fish.

# Family
Our oldest is 7, youngest is 4 months.
There are 11 X chromosomes in the family.
Everyone is well and cantankerous.
