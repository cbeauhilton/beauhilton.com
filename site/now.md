## family

boy howdy how time do fly

me: hi there! 

love of my life: building, always building - but she's also the one who is teaching me true rest

oldest: 10, youngest: 3. I don't usually put kid stuff online; they'll write their own stories when they're ready.

one dog died (the Welsh Terrier - Forrest - intestinal torsion, fairly quick and very bloody)

the other, Goldendoodle Archie, is now recovered from multiple surgeries and doing great - hobbles a bit but can sprint when he feels like it

such chicken, many clucks

plants, plants, everywhere - 
come have dinner some time, 
smoked pork belly with groundcherry + pepper medley is on the menu


## work

I'm a second-year oncology fellow at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
It's the best gig I've had so far. 

The past four years were intense 
(see this classic [1-minute Glauckomflecken video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IopdA7ZccmQ) 
on the truly insane and unhealthy mental model of time that residency imparts),
but I learned how to be a doctor (ongoing task, but the foundation is there, and I'm grateful for it).

Now I see patients in VA oncology clinic for a half-day a week, 
have roughly one weekend a month of hospital rounding and home call,
plus one week every 1-2 months of "jeopardy" 
(true call, i.e. work coverage for any fellow who needs it),
and do research with the rest of my work time. 

The past four years also paid modestly. 
Trainee salaries are public - here's the [VUMC trainee salary page](https://www.vumc.org/gme/stipends).
I'm a PGY4 now, 
and this year, per plan, 
we started receiving extra Harrison Society salary support on top of the PGY4 pay.
This adds up to about 30% more pay, for less work.
This combination is good for the family, and for my sanity. 
God bless the Harrison Society (this is, in every way, a sincere statement).

The research is data science stuff. 
Bibliometrics got me all jazzed.
I'll put links here as they become available.

In another three years I'll finish fellowship,
ideally with a faculty job and research funding (or the makings of it) well in place.

## other

The JGL movie [50-50](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1306980/) 
came up when I was chatting with one of my young patients who has cancer.

I love this movie, and wanted to know what he thought - 
he's about halfway through a very intense regimen,
and similar in age to the protagonist.

It earned a rave review. I worried it would be too raw,
but the patient told me it was cathartic.

Check it out, if you're in the mood.

Or, if you'd like to read something instead, 
try on [Deep River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_River_(novel)) by Shūsaku Endō.

Possibly my favorite book.
Written near the end of Endō's life.
Ensemble cast. 
A Japanese tourist group goes to India, 
each member carrying a complex backstory.

Pain, humor, sex, celibacy, violence, ultraviolence, kindness, ultrakindness - it's all here.

Endō, as he aged, did not mellow, 
but rather became more fiercely open, 
yet condemned none save the pretentious
(there was a fellow born in the Near East 
a little over two thousand years ago 
who had a similar viewpoint).
