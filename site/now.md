## work

Nearing the end of the second out of three years of oncology fellowship.
I'm going into private practice, and super psyched about it.
We're working with some incredible groups across the South and Southeast to find the right fit.
It's going to be tough to decide - 
the modern oncology private practice has the potential to be a magical place,
and so many groups are Doing Things Right.
