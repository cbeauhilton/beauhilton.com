On the night of December 2nd, 2018, I was too angry to sleep.
I'm not easy to ruffle 
(one of my cofellows dubbed me "Beau 'Cool-as-a-Cucumber' Hilton" - 
I have many faults, but easy ruffleability is not among them), 
and I have narcolepsy,
so I can count the number of nights I've spent both angry and sleepless on a single finger.

That afternoon I was reflecting on the plenary session
given by Dr Leon Tshilolo
at the American Society of Hematology 60th Annual Meeting,
where he presented data on the use of hydroxyurea
in sickle cell disease
in Africa.
It was a beautiful talk,
a major advance in the field of hematology,
and a wakeup call.

Hydroxyurea is an inexpensive drug that makes a huge difference
for many folks with sickle cell disease,
and has been used for decades.
The majority of people with sickle cell disease live in Sub-Saharan Africa.
(The paper that accompanied Dr Tshilolo's talk, 
which was published in The New England Journal of Medicine 
roughly one month later,
began with the characteristically understated:
"Hydroxyurea is an effective treatment for sickle cell anemia, 
but few studies have been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, 
where the burden is greatest.")
This study deserved to be the plenary session.
Unlike ever-more-expensive targeted therapies 
that benefit a few with rare diseases 
(I do not disparage these drugs, far from it,
but the contrast is poignant),
this is a cheap therapy that can benefit millions.
Recognizing the incredible scientific, 
political, and financial maneuvering 
that led to this study and its positive outcomes, 
as the day went on my initial elation
turned to depression,
then to anger. 
That this study happened at all is a triumph,
that it took this long to happen is a tragedy.

So I sat in my hotel room,
furious,
imagining,
lost.

I was trained as an anthropologist
and activist
at the same time I was trained as a scientist,
and here was a disturbing revelation
that seemed to fit squarely in my Venn Diagram,
but what I could do about it,
how I could make a difference,
how I could even know where to start,
escaped me.
Eventually the sun surprised me,
and the next day took me
(thankfully, 
there were some less-electrifying talks 
to sleep through later that day).
