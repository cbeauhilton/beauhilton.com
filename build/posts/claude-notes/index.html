     Writing clinical notes using AI - a practical experience

    <p id="post-excerpt">
     With Claude 3 Opus (a newish ChatGPT4 competitor) as my copilot, I wrote a pretty darn good SOAP note
    for an (invented yet realistic) new consult visit. It took a little massaging to get it right,
    but boy howdy, it did a great job. Here are the prompts and outputs. 
    This stuff has serious potential for streamlining the boring and tedious parts of the job.
    </p>
    <h2>
     LLM, the Great and Terrible
    </h2>
    <p>
     <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude">Claude</a> is one of
several new kids on the block in the land of highly capable Large
Language Models (LLMs), and is comparable to (but exceeding in certain
aspects) the incumbent ChatGPT4.
    </p>
    <p>
     I decided to see how it would do writing a SOAP note for an imaginary
(but common and realistic) new patient consult in an oncology
clinic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why “the Great and Terrible?” Everybody knows by now that LLMs are
great at a lot of things, including writing coherent and fluent English
and conforming to pretty much any common text format you can find online
(from legal documents to Python or JavaScript code). Most folks also
know that LLMs aim to please, and will make up the details they lack in
order to satisfy your request, so their output cannot be trusted too
far, particularly in technical areas. My goal in this was to see how
close I could get to a usable clinic note, with full awareness that it
was going to hallucinate and require a tune-up on the back end. In other
words, I am confident LLMs are “terrible” in certain ways, but needed
convincing that they are “great” in this particular arena.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Round 1: The Initial Prompt
    </h2>
    <p>
     I asked Claude for the following:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      please write a maximally billable SOAP-style medical note for an
office visit with a new patient with likely stage III esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma. Note that we discussed the need for full
staging with FDG-PET CT to determine the final course of action, and the
risks and benefits of a CROSS-style chemoradiotherapy regimen if stage
III disease is confirmed vs systemic therapy if stage IV disease is
confirmed. The patient describes mild dysphagia to solid foods but
minimal weight loss, has no notable physical exam findings, and labs are
unremarkable other than mild anemia. I reviewed the available
cross-sectional imaging and concur with the radiologist’s report.
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     And here’s the output:
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
     Here is a maximally billable SOAP-style medical note for the patient
encounter you described:
    </p>
    <p>
     S (Subjective): 62 yo M with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer
presents to oncology clinic to establish care and discuss treatment
options. Reports mild dysphagia to solid foods x 3 weeks but denies
significant weight loss, odynophagia, chest pain, nausea/vomiting,
hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or other GI symptoms. ROS negative
except as above. PMH notable for HTN, HLD, and GERD. FH neg for GI
malignancies. SH former smoker, quit 10 years ago, 30 pack-year history.
Married, retired accountant, lives at home with wife. Medications
include lisinopril, atorvastatin, omeprazole. No known allergies.

     <li>
      RTC in 1 week to review PET/CT results and finalize treatment plan.
Sooner prn for worsening dysphagia, intolerance of po.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <p>
     The LLM has added in a host of things I didn’t ask it for
specifically but do appreciate it including, which is what I hoped for
when I asked for a “maximally billable note” - e.g. the review of
systems, PMH, FH, SH, a reasonable assessment and plan for the anemia,
RTC, etc. Certain aspects are completely fabricated (age, vital signs,
the specifics of the radiology report, labs). Some things are
technically correct but not what I would do (e.g. very few people in the
US use the EOX regimen), so would need adjusting. I was a bit surprised
that it went ahead and put in the general plan for CROSS too - those
details are correct.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Round 2: The Placeholder Marks
    </h2>
    <p>
     I asked Claude to replace the invented values with placeholder marks
so I could fill them in later:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      That’s pretty good. Instead of inventing vital signs, imaging
reports, and lab values, please write it again to instead put in ***
placeholder marks in these areas so I can fill them in later.
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Claude obliged, creating a SOAP note template with *** all over the
place. It was a bit too much, as you can see:
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
     Sure, here’s the revised SOAP note with placeholder marks:
    </p>
    <p>

    <hr>
    <h2>
     Round 3: The Goldilocks Zone
    </h2>
    <p>
     Finally, I hit what seems to be a sweet spot:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Forget what I said, please only put in *** placeholders for vital
signs and imaging. It’s ok to make up values for everything else.
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     It still needs fixing, but isn’t so full of *** that it’s jarring (or
impossible to parse - what does “*** on ***” mean? Anything, and
nothing, that’s what.)
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
     Understood. Here’s the updated SOAP note with *** placeholders for
vital signs and imaging only:
    </p>

    <h2>
     The Verdict
    </h2>
    <p>
     Overall, writing the first LLM prompt, copying the result into the
chart, and adjusting it for correctness would take about 5 minutes.
Improving the prompt as I did adds some time, but you can keep whatever
prompt engineering bits you figure out for future use. You could also
build yourself a custom template and ask it to fill it out, which would
likely prevent many of the hallucinations (e.g. prepopulate placeholders
for the vitals, labs, imaging, and tell the LLM to leave those
alone).
    </p>
    <p>
     Really, not bad for concise yet comprehensive documentation of a new
consult. For subsequent visits, copying the note forward and adjusting
for new details would be more efficient than going back to the LLM.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here’s the crazy thing about all of the above: the LLM did not ingest
any PHI whatsoever - I gave it a general description of the case only.
No HIPAA is violated. No EMR integration is necessary - this would work
as well in CPRS as it would in Epic. Together, these two features are
powerful, and means you can use this starting today.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know a lot of organizations are nervous about LLMs and AI in
medicine in general, but I’m not certain I understand the hesitation in
this particular arena. The responsibility is still yours for accurate
documentation. The plan is also still yours, developed together with the
patient. Many efficiencies can be gained without needing HIPAA-violating
specifics, and without somehow asking the AI to become the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also, as a friend pointed out the other day, many, many clinical
notes are chock full of mistakes, whether typos or things copied forward
and not corrected, or more egregious things like true mistakes in
clinical reasoning. It seems to me, based on my brief experience, that
using a smarter Clippy would serve more to cut down these kinds of
errors, rather than propagating sins worse than those we already commit.
No electronic tool, whether a copy button in Epic or a powerful LLM, is
any kind of replacement for being a good clinician or an excuse for
shoddy work. But, on the same token*, I also don’t insist on counting
RBCs myself for every CBC I order - this is a good technological
cognate, since I need to be able to recognize the situations in which
the automated counter doesn’t tell the whole truth, know when the
results in the computer are fishy, and be able to do the visual
inspection myself if necessary, but most of the time I can just order
the CBC and go on my merry way.
    </p>
    <p>
     * ha, “token.” There’s an LLM dad joke for ya.
    </p>
    <p>
     P.S. I asked Claude to write a blog post summarizing my experience
and including the prompts and outputs. It mostly sucked and needed a
complete rewrite. But then again, I didn’t try very hard on the prompt.
I’ve tried asking it to write insurance request letters (e.g. for the
FDG-PET CT, which sometimes gets rejected out of hand even though it’s
2024), consult request letters, consult response letters, and patient
summary letters. Those were all pretty good, minimal tweaking
needed.
