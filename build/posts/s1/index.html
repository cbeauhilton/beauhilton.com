     Drugs we can’t get: S1
    </h1>
    <p>
     <time id="post-date">2024-03-29</time>
    </p>
    <p id="post-excerpt">
     There are a number of interesting drugs used in the global market that,
    for one reason or another, do not have FDA approval and are therefore inaccessible
    in the US, at least outside of clinical trials. S1 is one of them: a better capecitabine.
    </p>
    <h2>
     What is S1?
    </h2>
    <p>
     S1 is the muy sexy common name of a drug manufactured by Taiho
Pharmaceutical in Japan. (It did get a brand name a few years after it
went to market: “Teysuno”).
    </p>
    <p>
     It is a combination of three drugs, all in a pill.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first is a prodrug, called tegafur or ftorafur (“FT” in many
papers), that converts to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the body.
Capecitabine, the only oral 5-FU agent we use in the US, is also a 5-FU
prodrug.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second is gimeracil, a drug that inhibits the enzyme
dyhydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). This reduces tegafur breakdown in
the GI tract, which allows it to make its way into the bloodstream.
(Patients with inherent DPD deficiency cannot break down drugs in this
family once they make it into the bloodstream, leading to potentially
lethal side effects from 5-FU and it’s cousins - gimeracil is only
creating a local DPD deficiency in the gut. Brilliant.).
    </p>
    <p>
     The third is oteracil, which prevents 5-FU activation in the GI
tract, reducing off-target local adverse effects (capecitabine has
horrible GI side effects in many patients). Also brilliant.
    </p>
    <p>
     <img src="/images/s1-is.png" alt="The FU drugs, including S1">
    </p>
    <p>
     This is a very rationally conceived drug. Using a prodrug with a
companion that lets it survive long enough to be absorbed lets us use an
oral formulation. Oral is so much more convenient than a pump the
patient has to wear for a couple of days (and which sometimes
malfunctions in strange ways). In capecitabine we already have an oral
5-FU agent that works. However, many of the adverse effects of
capecitabine are local to the GI tract, leading to dose reductions or
drug switch in many cases, so combining something like capecitabine with
something that reduces badness in this location also makes a lot of
sense.
    </p>
    <p>
     This rationality bears out in clinical practice as well (this is not
always the case - a popular saying amongst clinical trialists is “the
road to hell is paved with biological plausibility.” The majority of
ideas that work out well in a petri dish or animal model do not work out
at all when we try them in humans. Hence clinical trials.). Trial after
trial have established S1 as the standard of care in many relevant
regimens in Asia, pretty much any situation where we would use
infusional 5-FU or capecitabine in the US. (I’m sure there’s nuance
here, but it appears generally true.) S1 works well, is easier to give,
and is better tolerated.
    </p>
    <h2>
     So why don’t we have it in the US?
    </h2>
    <p>
     Good. Question.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s not that it has been completely ignored by researchers in the
West, as you’ll see. The Europeans can get it. And I’m sure Taiho would
love to expand their market to the US.
    </p>
    <p>
     Truthfully, I can’t say I know all the reasons. These things are
complex and the FDA’s reasons are not always readily apparent or written
clearly (though they often are - I have equally strong respect and
disdain for that particular agency, but the trend in my feeling is
toward respect. I used to feel only disdain. The more I learn what and
how they do All The Things, the more I see a bunch of humans really
trying to do their best, rationally to the extent possible, in difficult
situations, with many conflicting interested parties).
    </p>
    <p>
     The clearest reason that S1 is a Big Deal in Asia but unknown here is
a difference in the prevalence of certain versions of enzymes that
convert the tegafur to 5-FU.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>Aside: I’m going to use the terribly imprecise terms “Asian” and
“Westerner.” The studies in this area use the terms “Asian” and
“Caucasian,” which is worse, as in, “even more wrong than the
alternative I chose.” There is huge genetic and biologic variability
within and across the places we call “Asia” and “The West,” and, if
humans do anything, humans migrate. This biped was made for walkin’, and
that’s just what it do. Don’t take these terms too seriously.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Folks from Asian countries tend to have a set of CYP2A6 polymorphisms
that lead to much slower conversion of this particular drug, or, more
appropriately said (Taiho is a Japanese company, after all), Westerners
tend to have a CYP2A6 reality that makes them convert tegafur too damn
fast. Dose-finding studies correspond well with the known differences in
enzymes: the recommended daily dose in Asia is 40mg/m2 twice a day,
whereas the Western dose is 30mg/m2 twice a day.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are other findings from the dosing studies that don’t precisely
line up with differences in processing after absorption. The most severe
toxicity in Asian populations is bone marrow suppression, whereas it is
GI toxicity in Western populations. I don’t know why the oteracil
doesn’t pull its weight in the guts of Westerners. Then again, it might
be entirely unrelated to oteracil, I have no idea.
    </p>
    <h2>
     The Dutch, as usual, are leading the way
    </h2>
    <p>
     The most interesting study to-date using S1 in Westerners was done in
the Netherlands and published as the “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdx122">SALTO Study</a>.”
    </p>
    <p>
     (S1 has approvals in Europe, though for a much shorter list of
indications compared with Japan and China, so folks governed by the EMA
can get it and play around, whereas there is no provision at all for
getting it in the US outside of clinical trial - it has orphan
designation but is not approved for anything)
    </p>
    <p>
     They looked at 161 patients who qualified for 5-FU-based monotherapy
for metastatic colorectal cancer. Combination drug therapy is the
standard of care frontline therapy in the metastatic setting, but
monotherapy is a reasonable option for older and more frail patients,
which is who this trial enrolled. They were randomized to S1 vs
capecitabine, and compared efficacy as well as rates of adverse effects.
Efficacy was comparable, and most adverse effects were also comparable,
with the notable exception of hand-foot syndrome. The rates of this were
45% in the S1 group, vs 73% in the capecitabine group. They were also
better able to maintain dose intensity in the S1 group, which is a good
surrogate for the <em>je ne sais quoi</em> of all the little things that
being on therapy does to a person but aren’t fully captured in the other
metrics. Though hand-foot syndrome is not a lethal problem, it can be a
huge quality-of-life problem, particularly when the point of therapy is
palliative in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     The same group also published a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186X.2016.1278459">retrospective</a>
on 52 patients who had hand-foot syndrome on capecitabine and were
switched to S1, which they then tolerated beautifully. The graph below
is from this paper. “Before” is on the left, and “after” is on the
right. The difference is stark.
    </p>
    <p>
     <img src="/images/s1-cape-hfs.jpg" alt="HFS improves significantly after switching from capecitabine to S1">
    </p>
    <h2>
     Why I’d love to have S1 in the US
    </h2>
    <p>
     One tough part of my job is telling somebody who wants to continue
therapy but isn’t tolerating the “easiest” form of therapy, even after
dose reduction and maximizing supportive care, that their only options
are to continue to push forward with the poorly tolerated therapy (to a
degree - I’m not afraid to say no and refuse to prescribe if I feel like
I’m hurting someone), or stop cancer-directed therapy altogether. I love
hospice and the services it provides, and many patients are relieved to
make this move, but a significant portion are not. Having another option
in the armamentarium, something else to try for the patient who wants to
try something, especially in such a commonly used class of drugs, would
be great. S1 has clear benefit for patients who have an indication for
5-FU-based therapy but have developed significant hand-foot syndrome,
and I would use it in this situation if I had it on formulary.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also, though I practice in “the West,” not everyone here hails from
the Caucasus
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>“Harumph,” he roared, suddenly on his feet and staring down at
me, his tweed’s elbow patches straining as he assumed the pose of a
portly academic Superman, “most Caucasians do not, in fact, hail from
the Caucasus. Very few do. That was proto-eugenic Neo-Platonic foolery.
If you use the term Caucasian, you have to accept the fallacious
philosophy upon which it was built, and you are equally obligated to
accept the terms from which it is inextricable, namely ‘Caucasoid,’
‘Mongoloid,’ ‘Negroid.’ Good sir, I do not believe this was your purpose
nor desire. If you must use an imprecise term, at least let it be one of
the cardinal directions, which are not unladen but are not actively
destructive of scientific and societal progress, good sense, morality,
and decency.” The final word was given in a whisper.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
     so having S1 as an up-front option for folks of Asian ancestry would
be nice - it’s a clearly better drug in Asian countries, and I doubt it
was the ground underfoot that made the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
     An idea related to this, with perhaps more biological justification
than a nebulous definition of ancestry, would be to deploy CYP2A6
screening of some sort to select folks who may most benefit from S1
rather than capecitabine.
    </p>
    <p>
     This could be done in several ways, all of which have precedence in
other types of screening and at some centers. Ideally you’d do trials to
determine if any of these actually pan out (see above, on the path to
hell). They’re all extrapolations.
    </p>
    <p>
     One option would be to screen all patients with known Asian ancestry,
as is done in some centers for various indications (e.g. GPD deficiency
screening for patients of African descent prior to starting potentially
problematic drugs).
    </p>
    <p>
     Another would be to screen only those who have had dose-limiting GI
intolerance to capecitabine, to make an argument that perhaps they would
tolerate S1 better. (Though, in reality, if S1 was suddenly available
and someone’s GI adverse effects were particularly horrendous on
capecitabine, I’d probably talk with the patient about it and try it if
they want, rather than what I might normally do, which would be to try
infusional 5-FU or a drug from a different class, depending on the
specifics of the situation. I think an empiric approach would be
appropriate, as it wouldn’t require fancy testing which may or may not
actually be predictive, and is what we do most of the time with other
cognate drugs, even if they have class-effect toxicities - some folks
just tolerate Drug A better than Drug B).
    </p>
    <p>
     A third option would be to screen everyone to try and find folks with
compatible CYP2A6 to select for up-front S1. This is expensive. Only
fancy places do population-wide pharmacogenomics (etc.) in practice, and
there are deep debates about how much good this actually does. But hey,
cool if you can get it, especially if you have data to back it up, but
even then make you’d have to make sure you don’t take it without a grain
or six of salt.
    </p>
    <p>
     As it is, even if I wanted to test out some of these ideas, or see if
the Dutch prospective study replicates, I’d have to go through an insane
approval process, and it would be expensive and time consuming. If the
drug was approved and available, studies like the Dutch retrospective
become almost trivially easy.
    </p>
    <p>
     One day. Maybe when the Big Boss of the FDA starts reading my blog
and sends me a golden goose for my genius, along with a Christmas basket
full of S1 and Cadbury. (That’s how it works, right?)
    </p>
    <h2>
     Until next time
    </h2>
    <p>
     This kind of thing is one of my favorites, a thoroughly enjoyable
line of inquiry - what drugs are out there that I can’t get? What
inspiration is there to be had from the practice patterns of other
countries? Would those drugs and patterns work here - why or why
not?
    </p>
    <p>
     It pairs nicely with my obsession with the histories of therapies for
cancers. Love me a critical genealogy,* love me some heteroglossia and
unfinalizability. Butler and Bakhtin ftw.
    </p>

     * I idly wondered if there had been much movement on that term, which
I got at least thirdhand from Judith Butler, and it looks like there’s
going to be a cool book coming out in the next year or two: <a href="https://absolute-disruption.com/a-genealogy-of-genealogy/">A
