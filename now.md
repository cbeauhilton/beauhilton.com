# Residency, Second Year
In 2020 I finished [medical school](https://portals.clevelandclinic.org/cclcm/),
matched into internal medicine residency
and hematology/oncology (cancer and blood disorders) fellowship
at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the [Harrison Society](https://medicine.vumc.org/harrison-society).

I completed my first year of internal medicine residency training, 
and started year two on July 1st, 2021.

All the things they say about residency training are true.

Fellowship starts around this time next year.

# Family
Our oldest is 8, youngest is 18 months.
Everyone remains well and cantankerous.
