     The first detailed description of living with esophageal cancer -
John Casaubon‚Äôs 1690 diary

     John Casaubon was an English surgeon in the late 1600s
who developed an esophageal tumor in late 1690 
and wrote about it in his diary
before dying in January of 1691.
It's harrowing, enlightening, and strangely beautiful.
This blog post is the only place in the world you can read the full transcription of the diary entry.

    <h2>
     Context
    </h2>
    <p>
     A couple of friends and I wrote a <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16030618">paper</a> on the history
of esophageal cancer, mentioned elsewhere on this blog.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the neat things in the paper is the first full transcription
of a diary entry from John Casaubon, which is the first first-person
detailing of esophageal cancer I can find. It‚Äôs the last entry in the
diary, and from what I could gather he died within the next week or two.
It has been transcribed in partial form in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gtc.2009.01.003">other</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28952239/">papers</a>, but I had
to know what I was missing in the ellipses, so wrote to the archivist at
the Southampton City Archives in the United Kingdom, who was great and
sent me a scan of the relevant page. The copyright for the microfilm
scan of the diary is owned by the British Library (oh, the complexities
of copyright), but the text itself is ancient and therefore public
domain, so I finished the transcription and included it in the paper. My
transcription also does not attempt to modernize or ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù any of the
spelling or punctuation: this is exactly what he wrote (including using
‚Äú2‚Äù instead of ‚Äúto,‚Äù and the absolutely delightful 1600s British
phonetic spelling of the word ‚Äúinside‚Äù as ‚Äúinsoaed‚Äù).
    </p>
    <p>
     However! I should say, ‚ÄúOne of the neat things in the paper was
<em>supposed</em> to be‚Ä¶‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
     Somehow, at some point in the revision process, a line in the
transcription disappeared. None of us noticed the omission, focused as
we were on other things the reviewers wanted tuned up. The transcription
is also present in full in my author‚Äôs working copy, so I have no idea
how a small chunk was omitted. There was no copy-pasta, I sent the
working copy to the journal in full. In any case, I wrote to the journal
to ask that the missing line be added, and, after a review process, was
refused. It doesn‚Äôt change the scientific conclusions of the paper, and
would require publishing a correction, so they said no. I pushed back,
as it is the only truly unique discrete data in the whole paper
(everything else is contextualization, arrangement, and interpretation
of prior publications). Alas, I suppose my humanist‚Äôs heart has
different priorities than the scientific journal‚Äôs editors.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, now, this blog post is the only public place you can find the
whole transcription. That‚Äôs a bummer, I wish it was immortalized in a
PubMed-indexed journal article, but this is the next best thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are interested in what was omitted in the journal article‚Äôs
version, I split out the missing section below.
