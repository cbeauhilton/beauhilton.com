     On the night of December 2nd, 2018, I was too angry to sleep. I‚Äôm not
easy to ruffle (one of my cofellows dubbed me ‚ÄúBeau ‚ÄòCool-as-a-Cucumber‚Äô
Hilton‚Äù - I have many faults, but easy ruffleability is not among them),
and I have narcolepsy, so I can count the number of nights I‚Äôve spent
both angry and sleepless on a single finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     That afternoon I was reflecting on the plenary session given by Dr
Leon Tshilolo at the American Society of Hematology 60th Annual Meeting,
where he presented data on the use of hydroxyurea in sickle cell disease
in Africa. It was a beautiful talk, a major advance in the field of
hematology, and a wakeup call.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hydroxyurea is an inexpensive drug that makes a huge difference for
many folks with sickle cell disease, and has been used for decades. The
majority of people with sickle cell disease live in Sub-Saharan Africa.
(The paper that accompanied Dr Tshilolo‚Äôs talk, which was published in
The New England Journal of Medicine roughly one month later, began with
the characteristically understated: ‚ÄúHydroxyurea is an effective
treatment for sickle cell anemia, but few studies have been conducted in
sub-Saharan Africa, where the burden is greatest.‚Äù) This study deserved
to be the plenary session. Unlike ever-more-expensive targeted therapies
that benefit a few with rare diseases (I do not disparage these drugs,
far from it, but the contrast is poignant), this is a cheap therapy that
can benefit millions. Recognizing the incredible scientific, political,
and financial maneuvering that led to this study and its positive
outcomes, as the day went on my initial elation turned to depression,
then to anger. That this study happened at all is a triumph, that it
took this long to happen is a tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
     So I sat in my hotel room, furious, imagining, lost.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was trained as an anthropologist and activist at the same time I
was trained as a scientist, and here was a disturbing revelation that
seemed to fit squarely in my Venn Diagram, but what I could do about it,
how I could make a difference, how I could even know where to start,
escaped me. Eventually the sun surprised me, and the next day took me
(thankfully, there were some less-electrifying talks to sleep through
later that day).
