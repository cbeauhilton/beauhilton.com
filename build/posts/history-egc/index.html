    <h1>
     A timeline of esophageal cancer
    </h1>
    <p>
     <time id="post-date">2023-10-20</time>
    </p>
    <p id="post-excerpt">
     A couple of friends and I wrote a review article on the history of esophageal cancer.
The timeline was so interesting I thought I'd share it here, in a place where it can be easily found and updated.
    </p>
    <p>
     I‚Äôll put a link to the article when it‚Äôs published.
    </p>
    <p>
     For now, I‚Äôm not including any references, and this is an abbreviated
version. I hope to fix both of these things in the future, with the goal
of a definitive, comprehensive list with a clear paper trail (though a
list such as this does require some curation - I‚Äôm not interested in
every small technical advance, only major firsts and practice-changing
updates).
    </p>
    <p>
     As a side note, it would be cool if <a href="hemonc.org">HemOnc.org</a> had tables (<em>a</em> table? for
comparative work?) of all oncologic drug approvals, with dates and
indications, for every global approval agency. Maybe with a link to the
trial that led to each approval? (It‚Äôs not always 1:1 between
trial:approval, but would be nice to know for the majority of cases
where that pattern holds). It‚Äôs a huge task, but would be so useful for
clinicians, researchers, and investors. I‚Äôm amazed nobody has done this
yet, though there are some partial lists that were helpful. HemOnc does
have a few wiki entries on dates of drug approvals, but they‚Äôre sparse.
(It‚Äôs not an easy task, particularly for the Chinese approvals - the
only definitive source for the Chinese NMPA appears to be a pdf that is
in Chinese only. If you read Chinese and would like to help, please
shoot me an email - see the contact link above)
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are several steps ahead and beat me to building the drug
approval tables: brava/bravo/brave/bravi, please lmk and I‚Äôll send you a
string of happy, grateful emojis, and we can talk about
collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
     Likewise, if you know of an important event in esophageal cancer
history, have a reference, and think I should add it here, please
contact me.
