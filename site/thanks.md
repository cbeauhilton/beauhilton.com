This is a "thanks page."

Sections of personal sites such as [about](/about), 
[now](https://nownownow.com/about),
and [uses](https://uses.tech) pages
are nice ways for people visiting your site to get to know you better,
each from a slightly different angle.

This page is also meant to bring the reader and author closer together.
By sharing a "hey, thanks" to folks who made a difference that day,
it gets back to that old idea that we create each other in our relationships.
The author gets to reflect on and state the positive thing, and the reader,
whether or not he or she is the one being thanked, 
can get a kick out of watching joy and kindness flourish in the world.

If you like this idea
and decide to make your own thanks page,
please do,
and [let me know](/contact). I'll link to your page here.

Sincerity only - 
if you'd like to bitch about something or someone,
and it must be online,
write a proper [post](/posts).
