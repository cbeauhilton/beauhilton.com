  There are a lot of embedding models out there for LLMs.
  ColbertV2 is a neat one.
  Here are some thoughts and code examples.

## ColbertV2

The way you shove data into any embedding model can make a difference,
and ColBERT is no different.
I started off just giving it an html file 
with the entirety of a website ([vimbook's print-site one-pager](https://www.vim-book.org/print_page/)).
This had a bunch of junk that wasn't needed, 
which occasionally affected the 

[sqlite-utils insert-files](https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#id43)

Multiline script example:

```sh
# enable multilib - see link below
paru # make sure things are up to date generally
paru -S android-tools android-sdk-build-tools # includes adb and other goodies
reboot
```
