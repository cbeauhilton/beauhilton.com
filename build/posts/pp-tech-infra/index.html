     While I plan on being a physician-scientist forever, I'm not going to work in academia.
Over the past few years I've put together very cool infrastructure for giving academic talks (click "talks" above),
and it was making me sad that it might not get much use after I leave the university.
But then, a ray of sunshine: Why not use my slide deck infrastructure to help in patient conversations?
    </p>
    <h2>
     talks.beauhilton.com
    </h2>
    <p>
     Academics give lots of presentations. I gave at least one 15min
presentation per week in medical school, and still expect a few 15-45min
presentations per half-year in fellowship.
    </p>
    <p>
     PowerPoint was long ago eschewed in favor of online-first
presentation platforms, typically Google Slides. (Eventually Office365
came out and PowerPoint came on par with Google Slides, but I had
already moved away.) No emailing around files and accidentally sending
the old version, or running into an incompatible version of the
software, and the presentation could be modified all the way up to (and,
occasionally, during) the event itself. All you need is an internet
connection.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eventually I wanted to move away from proprietary infrastructure
altogether, so started using <a href="https://sli.dev">Slidev</a>.
Slidev is geared toward developers, and as such uses all
industry-standard web technologies, nicely packaged up to make it easy
to go from a text file to a nice-looking presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
     The defaults are great, and, since it‚Äôs all web standards, the sky is
the limit as far as customization.
    </p>
    <p>
     The presentation lives in a single text file (markdown). This makes
it easily versionable, tracked by git and backed up to [GitHub, GitLab,
self-hosted git solutions, etc.]. Since I keep a copy on GitHub, the
ease of editing while on-the-go approaches the ease of editing a Google
Slide (all you need is an internet connection and to be logged in).
    </p>
    <p>
     Once the presentation is online, I‚Äôm only ever a click or two away
from accessing it. I make sure everything is HIPAA-compliant, and to the
public internet it goes.
    </p>
    <p>
     It‚Äôs been great for making talks in my academic program, and, when I
thought I would stay in academia forever, it made sense to me to spend
the time to build out my own infrastructure and subdomain for talks.
    </p>
    <h2>
     emphasizing the ‚Äúphysician‚Äù in ‚Äúphysician-scientist‚Äù
    </h2>
    <p>
     Recently, I realized that I‚Äôd be happier shifting the
physician-scientist balance more toward physician and less toward
scientist, at least as measured by days per week dedicated to each.
While I think I‚Äôll always see myself as as physician-scientist, my
future oncology job (hopefully not ‚Äújobs,‚Äù but who knows) will be in
private practice, where I‚Äôll see patients 3 or 4 days per week and do
research with the other 0.5-2 days that remain.
    </p>
    <p>
     (The following three paragraphs are an aside on how much time is
spent on what in academia, and touches on why I decided to leave. I
should probably move this out and expand it into its own post. It
doesn‚Äôt have much to do with the core of this one.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Classic academia is usually patient care 0.5-1 day per week, research
the remainder - but that‚Äôs somewhat misleading, since academics
typically have a number of dedicated inpatient weeks, which may or may
not put a damper on the ability to do research during that time,
depending on how busy they get and whether it‚Äôs July (with brand new
trainees) or June (with seasoned trainees). Even accounting for this, it
doesn‚Äôt even out to the number of patient-care days per year in private
practice, not by a long shot, but for most folks it isn‚Äôt so freed from
day-to-day patient care as it is advertised on the tin. There are a some
academics who do a few weeks of inpatient care per year and that‚Äôs it,
no clinic, but that‚Äôs the exception.
    </p>
    <p>
     You also pay your own salary out of your research funding, so there‚Äôs
a large time burden of not doing research, but writing grants to
convince funders that your research is cool and worth funding. With the
research I do and am interested in continuing, a university
infrastructure adds little, where it isn‚Äôt actively working against me,
and I‚Äôd rather pay my salary, which will be much bigger, from taking
care of people in clinic than working through the weekend to meet grant
deadlines (while I may also still be on call for the hospital).
    </p>
    <p>
     The university infrastructure is great for basic and clinical
science, and some flavors of data science, but my scientometric stuff is
truly better if done vigilante-style, not attached to academia‚Äôs
politics, and predictive modeling/etc. is available and important to
private practice collectives (AON, USON, OneOnc), some of whom have more
robust data infrastructure than the universities do. My most successful
clinical data science project thus far was actually done under the
purview of Business Intelligence for Cleveland Clinic, working with the
Center for Clinical Artificial Intelligence, and the publication was the
side project - this is much more in line with what I may find myself
doing with clinical data science with one of the big three onc groups:
do the thing, do it well, and if you feel like publishing it, gravy. The
scientometric stuff is more classic research, where publication itself
is the deliverable, but even here I‚Äôm much more interested in publishing
a living website and tool than a paper in a journal.
    </p>
    <p>
     (And now, back to our regularly scheduled program.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Outside of academia, there‚Äôs a high chance I won‚Äôt give presentations
nearly as often as I am accustomed to. At first, this made me
simultaneously happy (presentations are so. much. work.) and sad (aww,
my cute little talks website will just gather dust. Poor buddy). Then! I
went to a dinner meeting to learn about renal cancer and get paid to
hang out with friends and eat, and most of the physicians talked about
bringing up primary data to help in discussions with patients. Most
physicians do this when they think it will help, and it certainly wasn‚Äôt
the first time I‚Äôd heard people talk about it, but the timing was right.
I realized that I have a great use for my talks website, and that I‚Äôve
already been using it this way for some time.
    </p>
    <h2>
     talks in clinic - data for shared decision-making
    </h2>
    <p>
     At least 3 or 4 times in the past few months, I‚Äôve been having
discussions with patients about their prognosis and various options, and
wished I had the graphs to show them without having to poke around
Google and possibly fight with a paywall, then realized I just gave a
talk on the same thing, the talk is on my website, and it has those
graphs.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was very useful to go over the primary data with the patient (not
everybody wants to see this stuff, but a significant number do), and
having a talk I gave to reference immediately lent an additional modicum
of trust to the conversation (most trust is built from showing you care,
but another portion is built from showing you know what you‚Äôre
doing).
    </p>
    <p>
     Hearing the physicians at that dinner meeting talk about how they‚Äôre
using primary data in their shared decision-making, combined with my
recent decision to go into private practice, and thoughts about what to
do with my website, led me to the following idea: for diseases I‚Äôm most
interested in, and for diseases I treat the most, it will be very useful
to have a talk I made and maintain, geared toward patients, to
immediately pull up and have available in clinic, and have the link to
give the patient for review, particularly in those conversations with
their loved ones where they‚Äôre trying to remember all the stuff you said
to make a group decision. It would also be easy and useful to have a
slide describing the regimen and its schedule, especially if the way
we‚Äôre giving it doesn‚Äôt quite match up with the published regimen (e.g.
one of the many regimens that is written as ‚Äú2 on, 1 off‚Äù but we‚Äôre
giving it every other week instead).
    </p>
    <p>
     I‚Äôm definitely not going to make a talk for every disease or use one
in every conversation, that would be insane and impossible to maintain,
but if I pay attention to the data I use repeatedly, a 30-60min session
adding some of these to a slide deck with a little explanation would
more than carry its weight in future conversations.
