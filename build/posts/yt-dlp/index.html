     yt-dlp Nix config
    </h1>

    <p id="post-excerpt">
     yt-dlp is an incredibly useful and customizable tool 
for downloading online videos
from YouTube and elsewhere.
Here's my setup 
(declared in Nix, but easily generalizable).
    </p>
    <p>
     If you just want the config, scroll to the bottom (ignore the
ramblings under the asterisk).
    </p>
    <h2>
     yt-dlp
    </h2>
    <p>
     youtube-dl was, for years, the de facto standard for retrieving
videos from YouTube (and other websites - e.g. Vimeo) for local use, but
eventually it got old and crufty.
    </p>
    <p>
     <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a> is a fork of
youtube-dl that is more actively maintained, with many upgrades.
    </p>
    <p>
     It has sane defaults, but I have a few things I change to make it
suit my uses.
    </p>
    <p>
     I mostly use it to download instructional videos so they‚Äôre easier to
use: no getting interrupted by ads whenever I scrub back and forth to
find or rewatch a particular section, and I can proceed without an
internet connection.
    </p>
    <p>
     It‚Äôs also a boon for archival of any video you use frequently for any
reason, e.g. in an educational setting - if you have a lesson plan that
depends on a clip from an online video, it is wise to have your own copy
of the video, both to reduce dependence on finicky wifi and to make it
more likely you‚Äôll have the vid for every time you repeat this lesson in
the future. Videos go offline for strange, sundry, and unpredictable
reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
     (I maintain that YouTube and related video sites, taken as a whole,
are the single greatest source of procedural knowledge ever created by
humankind* - the problems that threaten their utility are, first,
curation, and second, durability)
    </p>
    <h2>
     configuring
    </h2>
    <p>
     yt-dlp accepts a config file, usually placed at
<code>~/.config/yt-dlp/config</code>, so you don‚Äôt have to have a long
string of flags and options in your shell command to yt-dlp (you can
override your config file with shell options, so it‚Äôs reasonable to set
your defaults to your most common use and not worry about messing up
some divergent situation that may come up).
    </p>
    <p>
     For example, to download the whole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnWatsonRooney">JohnWatsonRooney
YouTube channel</a>, all I had do was:
    </p>
    <pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-sh"><span class="hl kwb">cd</span> youtube<span class="hl kwb">-downloads</span><span class="hl opt">/</span>JohnWatsonRooney
yt<span class="hl kwb">-dlp</span> <span class="hl sng">"https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnWatsonRooney"</span>
</code></pre>
    <p>
     And it did something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
     <img src="/images/yt-dlp-downloading-example.png" alt="yt-dlp downloading example">
    </p>
    <p>
     Resulting in:
    </p>
    <p>
     <img src="/images/yt-dlp-filename-example.jpg" alt="yt-dlp filename example">
    </p>
    <p>
     In the second screenshot you can see that some files are still in
process - when all the parts are downloaded, yt-dlp smushes them into an
mkv container, so the videos/thumbnails/subtitle files are clean and
accessible to most video players.
    </p>
    <h2>
     config
    </h2>
    <p>
     Here‚Äôs my config file, with some annotation.
    </p>
    <p>
     I‚Äôm using Nix with Home Manager, but you can translate this into the
usual yt-dlp config file syntax with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the great things about Nix is that it lets me group
installation and configuration for programs that make sense together -
here, I want to use aria2 as the downloader, so I declare the aria2
options to pass to yt-dlp, and also make sure aria2 is installed (it‚Äôs
ok if you installed aria2 in another part of your setup - if a program
is declared for installation in multiple places, Nix is smart enough to
install it only once, so it‚Äôs often wise to err on the side of
bundling).
    </p>
    <p>
     If I take this config to any other machine with Nix installed, I‚Äôll
get the whole setup including dependencies. This example is very simple,
just adding another program, but the principle scales to arbitrarily
complex setups.

    <p>
     * Contrary to popular belief, things that go online do <em>not</em>
stay online forever: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_obsolescence">digital
obsolescence</a> is real, and is <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2023/03/25/the-fight-continues/">probably
going to get worse</a> before it gets better (‚Äú?better‚Äù). This section
is under an asterisk and at the end because it is a side thought, just
an idea that tools like yt-dlp may have import that goes beyond helping
me write web scrapers, build saunas, etc. - maybe they have the
primitives to help build a videographic Whole Earth Catalog for the
ages. I don‚Äôt think everything is going to explode any time soon, but
wouldn‚Äôt it be interesting to have a digital archive with videos, rather
than just text, of how to do the basic things (and some not-so-basic
things) that make life possible and enjoyable? Some kind of all-in-one
system with redundant storage and a power-supply (hand crank? solar?),
durable screen and speakers, to help you bootstrap the physical needs of
a society? I‚Äôm sure the raw content is out there.
